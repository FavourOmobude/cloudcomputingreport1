### FOUNDATION ON CLOUD COMPUTING BY AFRICA CLOUD PAPA.
_**What is cloud computing?**_

Cloud computing is an on demand delivery of it resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying,owing and maintaining physical data centres and servers you can access technology services such as computing power storage and data bases as needed basis from a cloud provider,like Amazon Web Services [AWS]. Example is, a company wouid buy computers and rent it out to other companies or individuals for them to use at a particular time or particular place,meaning if a company needs to get a job done for six month,it can be done in few days.

_**Advantages of cloud computing**_ 

1. Backup and restore data: Once the data is stored in cloud,it is easier to get backup and restore data using the cloud.
2. Improve Collaboration: This improves collaboration by allowing groups of people to quickly and easily share information in the cloud via shared storage.
3. Excellent Accessibility: Cloud allows us to quickly access,store information,anywhere anytimein the whole world using internet connection. An internet cloud infastructure increases organisation productivity and efficiency by ensuring that data is always accessible anywhere in the world.
4. Low Maintenance Cost: Cloud computing produces both hardware and software maintenance cost for organisations.
5. Services in the pay-per-use Model: If you want to use AWS for one day,you pay for one day,if you wish to use for a month,you pay for a month,if it is for a year,you pay for a year.

# VIRTUALIZATION

This is a technology that you can use to create virtual representations of servers,storage,networks,and other physical machines. Virtual software mimic the functions of physical hardware to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single physical machine.
Business uses virtualization to use their hardware resources efficiently and get greater returns from their investments. It alsopowers cloud computing services that help organisation manage infastructure more efficiently.

 _**Importance of virtualization**_

1. It reduces cost(e.g electricity,space,maintenance) meaning you can have one physical computer and create like to virtual computers
2. You are not limited by proximity,meaning you do not need to go to a physical place to access your computer,you can access them anywhere you are in the world.
3. Developers can test different application on differnt operating systems with ease.
   
# HYPERVISOR

This is a program use to run and manage one or more virtual machines on a computer.

 _**Types of hypervisor**_

* Type 1 hypervisor : Use to install directly on the hardware,e.g oracle virtual machines (Oracle VM)
* Type 2 hypervisor : Runs directly on the host computer physical hardware. These hypervisor are faster and more efficient than type 2 hypervisors,e.g microsoft hypervisor.

_So basically,this class ended on a practical aspect of downloading a virtualbox and ubuntu._
